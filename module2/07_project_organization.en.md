## Project organization

* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> Is there a market regulated? <span style="font-style: italic;">Regulated markets typically means a lot of paperwork, waterfall-like processes and very formal approaches to everything. Might be what you want, but make sure to think twice.</span>
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> How to introduce a change/fix/improvement? How long does it take? <span style="font-style: italic;">After proving this is work it with PoC or a fair discussion, this should be a no-event.</span>
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> How much time is dedicated to finding a new solutions and redesigning old ones? <span style="font-style: italic;">Many companies do not actually expect any change to come to their project. If so - RUN!</span>
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> What methodology do you use: SCRUM, RUP, SDLC+, none? <span style="font-style: italic;">Are you sure you want to take a part in project which main task is to produce documentation and/or meeting minutes?</span>
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> How do you document project? <span style="font-style: italic;">There are reasonable limits both ways - no documentation usually means no architecture and spaghetti code; tones of documentation usually means "programming in ms-word".</span>
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> Is project local or multi-site? <span style="font-style: italic;">Multi-site is not bad as such, but often means that a lot of politics gets involved in your daily work.</span>
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> Who makes project decisions (which company site/location)? <span style="font-style: italic;">It's all about decision making. Make sure your location have something to say.</span>
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> What is the policy if a bug is found in an open-source library? <span style="font-style: italic;">It's good to share - otherwise you'll need to maintain your "sneaky patch" forever...</span>
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> Does company maintain any open-source projects or participate in any? <span style="font-style: italic;">Again - openness for sharing</span>
