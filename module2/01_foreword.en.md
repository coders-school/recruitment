## Foreword

Contrary to some ppl's opinion, job interview works both ways: employer checks if your knowledge meets expectations, you check if this job will be fun and creative. Below is my personal list of questions I tend to ask, before accepting any job offer. Recently i decided to make a list out of these, since often, when i forgot about some parts, they came out not the way I expected... questions are important not to get disappointed on the first day. If the employer does not want to spare some time answering this, it means either you'll be another "human resource" no one gives a damn about, or is hiding something. Both cases you probably prefer to step back.
