## Trainings

* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> Does employer ensure trainings?
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> How often? How long? <span style="font-style: italic;">Employer should provide at least a few days training every year, as a "social minimum".</span>
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> Can you go to a conference? <span style="font-style: italic;">Sometimes on-site is the only option, so for instance <a href='https://conference.accu.org/'>ACCU-organized conferences</a> are out of scope.</span>
