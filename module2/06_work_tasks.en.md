## Work tasks

* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> What challenges shall I expect at work? <span style="font-style: italic;">If the tasks are to simple, you will be bored to death...</span>
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> Ask what could be your first 3 tasks (can be examples). What tasks you can get after 3-6 months? <span style="font-style: italic;">This will give you a nice overview on what you can expect at daily basis.</span>
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> Development? <span style="font-style: italic;">How much of an actual programming is there daily?</span>
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> Software architecture? <span style="font-style: italic;">Can you design or at least influence architecture?</span>
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> CM? <span style="font-style: italic;">Who does configuration management? Can it be influenced, if you see a field of improvement?</span>
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> Build management? <span style="font-style: italic;">Same as for CM.</span>
