## Afterword

Last but not least, there is one more important observation you should make. Think about the questions/tasks you were given during the interview. How hard they were for you? Were you able to answer all of them straight away or you had to think hard, maybe failed on some? The harder questions were, the better for you. Recruiters usually ask about things and skills that are required for a given job. If you found them hard and innovative, there is a good chance you'll actually learn a lot there and not get bored. In contrast, if the interview was simple (or even trivial) - this is the way your job probably will look like. Still interested? Being overqualified for a job is boring on a daily basis and a step back in a long term. If your kung-fu is really the best around, who do you plan to learn from?
