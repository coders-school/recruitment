## Workstations

* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> Is linux installed locally? <span style="font-style: italic;">Corporate environments are often abusing windows everywhere - even if it does not fit your job description.</span>
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> Working locally or remotely? <span style="font-style: italic;">Working on "very" remote machines may mean lags and latencies - not nice.</span>
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> What machine is there? <span style="font-style: italic;">Will it be reasonable fast to perform your work? If you develop locally loads of CPUs and RAM is what you want! :)</span>
