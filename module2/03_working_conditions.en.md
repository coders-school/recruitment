## Working conditions

* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> Where is the office located? <span style="font-style: italic;">Think about getting there and back a daily basis.</span>
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> Is there a place to park a car? <span style="font-style: italic;">Even if you don't use a car daily, sometimes it might be needed - where you will park then?</span>
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> Open space or separate rooms? <span style="font-style: italic;">I find open spaces noisy, which makes it impossible to focus on work - this in turn kills innovation.</span>
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> What is the dressing policy? <span style="font-style: italic;">Not everyone's finding working "under a tie" acceptable.</span>
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> Is there obligatory (long) lunch break? <span style="font-style: italic;">It's annoying when employer tells you when and how long you will be eating lunch. Especially when you usually don't...</span>
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> Ask recruiter "why do YOU like your job?". <span style="font-style: italic;">Nice way of observing if your (potential) future coworker really enjoying work, or "just works here".</span>
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> Can get support to do any off-time projects? <span style="font-style: italic;">Say: extra money for a hardware, or a space computation power at night.</span>
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> Have time for writing/creating publications? <span style="font-style: italic;">Some employers allow to publish interesting materials in magazines. This means +1 for your surname and +1 for company's PR.</span>
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> Have time for preparing conference talks? <span style="font-style: italic;">Some employers support presenting skills of they employees during conferences. This means +1 for your surname and +1 for company's PR</span>
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> Who will you work with? Seniors/juniors? Anyone known in the industry? <span style="font-style: italic;">The best bet would be to get a job where you are least experienced in the team - this will ensure you to learn a lot! :)</span>
